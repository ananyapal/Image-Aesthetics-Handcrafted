# Image-Aesthetics-Handcrafted
Python Project on Image Aesthetics using Handcrafted methods. Based on the photography rules such as ROT, DOF and Color Contrast. This was the initial part of my final project on the same topic using Deep Learning, which I won't be uploading. However, these are basics which are necessary for Image Processing.

The image path can be changed according to your image location.

Color contrast w grabcut.py	: Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Color Contrast
SVMcode.py	: SVM for evaluating aesthetic quality of images
dof.py	: Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Depth of Field
foreground background.py	: Separating Foreground and Background
grabcut.py	: Grabcut algorithm
rot.py  : Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Rule of Thirds
