# Image-Aesthetics-Handcrafted
Python Project on Image Aesthetics using Handcrafted methods. Based on the photography rules such as Rule of Thirds, Depth of Field and Color Contrast. This was the initial part of my final project on the same topic using Deep Learning which can be found here: https://github.com/ananyapal/Image-Aesthetic-Assessment-using-Deep-Learning.<br> The following are the basics which are necessary for Image Processing.
