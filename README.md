# Image-Aesthetics-Handcrafted
Python Project on Image Aesthetics using Handcrafted methods. Based on the photography rules such as Rule of Thirds, Depth of Field and Color Contrast. This was the initial part of my final project on the same topic using Deep Learning. The following are the basics which are necessary for Image Processing.

### Steps

The image path can be changed according to your image location.

Color contrast w grabcut.py	: Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Color Contrast

SVMcode.py	: SVM for evaluating aesthetic quality of images

dof.py	: Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Depth of Field

foreground background.py	: Separating Foreground and Background

grabcut.py	: Grabcut algorithm

rot.py  : Evaluating aesthetic quality based on Rule of Thirds
